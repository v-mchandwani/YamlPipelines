ADDING CONDITON OF SUCCESS AND FAILURE IN YAML
here job B will not run as Job A succeeded
 
pool:
  vmImage: ubuntu-latest
 
stages: 
    - stage: stage1
      jobs:
       - job: A
 
# job B runs if A fails
 
    - stage: stage2
      condition: failed()
      jobs:
      - job: B
 
# job C runs if B succeeds
    - stage: stage3
      dependsOn:
       - stage1
       - stage2
      condition: succeeded('B')
      jobs: 
       - job: C
 
here stage B will run as stage A failed as we didn't specify the pom.xml file in Maven task
 
pool:
  vmImage: ubuntu-latest
 
stages:
  - stage: stageA
    jobs:
    - job: jobA
      steps:
        - task: Maven@4
  - stage: stageB
    condition: failed()
    jobs:
    - job: jobB
 
  - stage: stageC
    dependsOn: 
      - stageA
      - stageB
    condition: succeeded('stageB')
 
    jobs:
      - job: jobC
 
by specifying condition: always() -> this step will always run even if the pipelines is cancelled
